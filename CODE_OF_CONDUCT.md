# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies
when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

To report unacceptable behavior, contact project maintainers privately:

- Open a private security report if safety/privacy is required
- Or contact the maintainer directly via GitHub profile: `@Himesh-Bhattarai`

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers
will respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1:

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla's code of conduct
enforcement ladder.
